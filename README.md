# html-accessibility-boilerplate

This project is a heavily commented html boilerplate/guide/reference page with references to WCAG 2.0 (and by extension Section 508) requirements and examples of conforming implementations.

This is a based on a boilerplate created by Gerard K. Cohen for this PluralSight course but is modified to include items addresed in the course that were not reflected in the original boiler plate.
